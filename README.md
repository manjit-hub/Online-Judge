# Online Judge

**🚧 This project is a work in progress and not yet completed.**

---

## Overview

The Online Judge project is a full-stack application designed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It is an online platform where users can participate in coding challenges by submitting their solutions, which are automatically evaluated against hidden test cases. The project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to enhance their coding skills, compete in contests, and view their performance statistics.

## Features

- **👤 User Registration**: Sign up using email or social media accounts.
- **🔧 Profile Management**: Edit personal information, track progress, and view submissions.
- **💡 Practice Problems**: Curated coding problems categorized by difficulty and topic.
- **🖥️ Code Compilation**: Online code editor and compiler with real-time feedback.
- **✅ Return Verdict**: Automatic evaluation of submissions with verdicts like Accepted, Wrong Answer, or Time Limit Exceeded.
- **🏆 Contests (Optional)**: Participate in coding competitions with real-time rankings.
- **📊 Leaderboard (Optional)**: Displays user rankings based on performance.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Scalability and Performance

- **⚖️ Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **📈 Auto-scaling**: Dynamically add or remove resources based on demand.
- **🚀 Efficient Code Execution**: Use a robust queue system to manage submissions.
- **🗂️ Caching and CDNs**: Reduce server load with caching mechanisms.

### Accurate and Fair Evaluation

- **🛠️ Standardized Test Environment**: Use containerization for consistent execution.
- **🔍 Comprehensive Test Cases**: Include extensive test cases for validation.
- **🔒 Sandboxing**: Execute code in a secure, isolated environment.
- **📅 Regular Monitoring**: Conduct audits and real-time monitoring.

## Workflow

2. **🔑 Login**: Access the platform using registered credentials.
3. **📝 Browse Problems**: View and select problems to solve.
4. **💻 Submit Code**: Write and submit code using the online editor.
5. **📋 Get Verdict**: Receive instant feedback on submissions.
6. **🏅 Compete in Contests** (Optional): Participate in real-time coding competitions.
7. **📊 View Leaderboard** (Optional): Check rankings and performance statistics.
